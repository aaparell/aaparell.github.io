We have also looked at the target of highest-paid boxing single fight, which is to generate as much revenue as possible. In the following sections, we will dive deeper into the topic and explore some of the most famous fights in boxing history.</p><p><h2>The Most Expensive Fight in Boxing History</h2></p><p>I remember watching the Floyd Mayweather vs. Manny Pacquiao fight in 2015, which is widely considered to be the most expensive fight in boxing history. As a huge boxing fan, I was excited to see two of the best fighters in the world go head-to-head. The fight generated a record-breaking $600 million in revenue, with Mayweather taking home a reported $300 million and Pacquiao earning $150 million.</p><p>The Mayweather vs. Pacquiao fight was a long time in the making, with negotiations between the two fighters and their promoters taking months to finalize. The fight was hyped up as the "Fight of the Century," with fans and experts alike eagerly anticipating the clash between two of the sport's biggest names. The fight itself was a bit of a letdown, with Mayweather taking a unanimous decision victory over Pacquiao in a fight that was criticized for being too defensive.</p><p><h2>The Second Most Expensive Fight in Boxing History</h2></p><p>The second most expensive fight in boxing history was the Mayweather vs. Conor McGregor fight in 2017. This fight generated $600 million in revenue, tying it with the Mayweather vs. Pacquiao fight for the most expensive fight in boxing history. Mayweather once again took home a reported $300 million, while McGregor earned $100 million.</p><p>The Mayweather vs. McGregor fight was unique in that it was a crossover event between boxing and mixed martial arts. McGregor, a UFC fighter, had never fought in a professional boxing match before, but he was able to hold his own against Mayweather for the first few rounds of the fight. In the end, however, Mayweather's experience and skill proved too much for McGregor, and he won the fight by technical knockout in the 10th round.</p><p><h3>The Boxers Who Have Made the Most Money in a Single Fight</h3></p><p>As we have seen, Floyd Mayweather is the boxer who has made the most money in a single fight. In addition to the two fights mentioned above, he also holds the record for the third most expensive fight in boxing history, which was his 2013 fight against Saul "Canelo" Alvarez. Mayweather earned $41.5 million for that fight.</p><p>Other boxers who have made a significant amount of money in a single fight include Manny Pacquiao, who earned $120 million for his fight against Mayweather, and Oscar De La Hoya, who earned $52 million for his fight against Mayweather in 2007.</p><p><h4>How to Watch the Next Highest-Paid Boxing Single Fight</h4></p><p>The next highest-paid boxing single fight is always a topic of speculation, with fans and experts eagerly anticipating the next big fight.
