This shirt can be worn with shorts, chinos, or even tailored trousers.</p><p>For a casual look, pair your short-sleeve button-down with a pair of shorts and sneakers. If you're going to a more formal event, wear it with a pair of chinos and loafers.</p><p><h4>4. The Lightweight Shorts</h4></p><p>No summer outfit is complete without a pair of lightweight shorts. Whether you prefer chino shorts, denim shorts, or cargo shorts, make sure they're comfortable and breathable.</p><p>I like to wear my chino shorts with a polo shirt and boat shoes for a classic summer look.

These shoes are comfortable and easy to wear, and they can be paired with almost any summer outfit.</p><p>I like to wear my slip-on sneakers with a pair of denim shorts and a t-shirt for a casual look.

Just make sure they're comfortable and appropriate for the occasion.</p><p><b>Q: Can I wear white after Labor Day?</b></p><p>A: Yes, you can definitely wear white after Labor Day.
