First and foremost, always follow the care instructions on the label. This may include washing in cold water, using a gentle detergent, and avoiding the dryer.</p><p>In addition to following care instructions, there are a few other tips to keep in mind. For example, always hang your shirts to dry rather than using a dryer, as this can cause shrinkage and damage the fabric.
