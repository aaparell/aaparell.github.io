It was a time when people wanted to be trendy and fashionable, and sunglasses were a must-have accessory. However, with so many brands and styles to choose from, finding the perfect pair of sunglasses could be a daunting task.</p><p>If you're searching for the perfect pair of sunglasses that will take you back to the 90s, then this post is for you. We'll be exploring the popular sunglasses brands of the 90s, what made them so popular, and where you can find them today.</p><p>In this post, we'll be discussing the following popular sunglasses brands in the 90s:</p><h2>Ray-Ban</h2><p>Ray-Ban is a brand that has been around since the 1930s, but it wasn't until the 90s that they became really popular. The company's Wayfarer and Aviator sunglasses were the go-to styles for celebrities and anyone who wanted to look cool. The Wayfarer was especially popular among the grunge and punk rock subcultures, while the Aviator was a hit with the hip hop community.</p><p>Personally, I remember saving up for a pair of Ray-Ban Wayfarers in high school. I felt like the coolest kid in school when I finally got them. Today, Ray-Ban is still a popular brand, and you can find their iconic Wayfarer and Aviator styles in many eyewear stores.</p><h2>Oakley</h2><p>Oakley was another brand that was popular in the 90s. Their wraparound sunglasses were a hit with athletes and sports enthusiasts, and their futuristic designs were popular with those who wanted to stand out.

Their polarized lenses were perfect for reducing glare on the water, and their colorful frames were a hit with anyone who wanted to add a pop of color to their outfit. Maui Jim's Hookipa and Kawika styles were especially popular.</p><p>I remember my mom wearing Maui Jim sunglasses when we went on family vacations to the beach. She loved how lightweight they were and how well they protected her eyes from the sun. Today, Maui Jim is still a popular brand, and you can find their sunglasses in many eyewear and outdoor stores.</p><h4>Versace</h4><p>Versace was a brand that defined luxury in the 90s. Their sunglasses were a hit with celebrities and anyone who wanted to make a fashion statement. Versace's Medusa and Biggie styles were especially popular.</p><p>I remember seeing Versace sunglasses on the pages of fashion magazines and on celebrities like Elton John and Madonna. They were a bit out of my price range back then, but I always admired them from afar. Today, Versace is still a popular brand, and you can find their sunglasses in many high-end eyewear stores.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p>Q: What made sunglasses so popular in the 90s?</p><p>A: Sunglasses became popular in the 90s because they were seen as a must-have accessory for anyone who wanted to be trendy and fashionable. Celebrities and supermodels were often seen wearing designer shades, and people wanted to emulate their style.</p><p>Q: Why were oversized sunglasses so popular in the 90s?</p><p>A: Oversized sunglasses were popular in the 90s because they were seen as glamorous and sophisticated. They also provided more protection from the sun and helped to hide tired eyes after a night out.</p><p>Q: Are any of the popular sunglasses brands from the 90s still popular today?</p><p>A: Yes, many of the popular sunglasses brands from the 90s are still popular today. Ray-Ban, Oakley, and Maui Jim are still popular brands that you can find in many eyewear and outdoor stores.</p><p>Q: What should I look for when buying sunglasses?</p><p>A: When buying sunglasses, you should look for a pair that provides 100% UV protection, fits well, and is comfortable to wear. You should also consider the style and shape of the sunglasses and whether they suit your face shape and personal style.</p><h2>Conclusion of Popular Sunglasses Brands in the 90s</h2><p>The 90s was a decade of fashion and style evolution, and sunglasses were a must-have accessory for anyone who wanted to be trendy and fashionable. Ray-Ban, Oakley, Maui Jim, and Versace were just a few of the popular sunglasses brands that defined the 90s. Today, many of these brands are still popular, and you can find their iconic styles in many eyewear and outdoor stores.
