Finding authentic Hawaiian shirts can be a daunting task, especially if you don't know where to start. It's important to know what to look for and where to buy to ensure you get the real deal. In this article, we'll share everything you need to know about where to buy authentic Hawaiian shirts.</p><h2>What to Look for in Authentic Hawaiian Shirts</h2><p>Before we dive into where to buy authentic Hawaiian shirts, let's first touch on what to look for when shopping. Authentic Hawaiian shirts are made from high-quality materials like cotton, rayon, or silk. They're known for their vibrant prints, which often feature tropical flowers, palm trees, or ocean waves. Look for shirts with genuine coconut buttons, as they're a hallmark of traditional Hawaiian shirts.</p><h2>Where to Buy Authentic Hawaiian Shirts</h2><p>When it comes to buying authentic Hawaiian shirts, there are several options to consider. Here are some of the best places to buy authentic Hawaiian shirts:</p><h3>Local Shops in Hawaii</h3><p>If you're in Hawaii, visiting local shops is the best way to find authentic Hawaiian shirts. There are plenty of options to choose from, including boutique shops, souvenir stores, and markets. Some of the top places to check out include Hilo Hattie, Bailey's Antiques and Aloha Shirts, and the Aloha Stadium Swap Meet.</p><h3>Online Stores</h3><p>If you're not in Hawaii, you can still find authentic Hawaiian shirts online. There are many online stores that specialize in selling Hawaiian shirts, including The Hana Shirt Co., Reyn Spooner, and Tori Richard. Make sure to read reviews and check the store's return policy before making a purchase.</p><h3>Secondhand Stores</h3><p>If you're looking for a vintage Hawaiian shirt, check out secondhand stores. You can find unique and authentic shirts from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Some of the best secondhand stores to visit include Buffalo Exchange, Crossroads Trading Co., and Goodwill.</p><h3>Tailors</h3><p>If you're looking for a custom-made Hawaiian shirt, consider visiting a tailor. They can create a shirt that fits perfectly and features the exact print you want. Some tailors that specialize in making Hawaiian shirts include Royal Hawaiian Creations, Nohea Gallery, and The Hawaiian Shirt Shop.</p><h2>Personal Experience: Buying Authentic Hawaiian Shirts in Hawaii</h2><p>During my recent trip to Hawaii, I visited several local shops to find authentic Hawaiian shirts. I found the best selection at Hilo Hattie, where I was able to find shirts made from high-quality materials with vibrant prints. The staff was knowledgeable and helpful, and I was able to find shirts in a variety of sizes. I also visited the Aloha Stadium Swap Meet, where I found more affordable options. Overall, I recommend visiting local shops in Hawaii to find authentic Hawaiian shirts.</p><h2>Tips for Buying Authentic Hawaiian Shirts</h2><p>To ensure you're getting an authentic Hawaiian shirt, here are some tips to keep in mind:</p><h4>Check the Label</h4><p>Look for labels that say "Made in Hawaii" or "Made in USA." This indicates that the shirt was made locally and is likely authentic.</p><h4>Feel the Material</h4><p>Authentic Hawaiian shirts are made from high-quality materials like cotton, rayon, or silk. They should feel soft and lightweight to the touch.</p><h4>Inspect the Buttons</h4><p>Authentic Hawaiian shirts should have genuine coconut buttons. Check that the buttons are firmly attached and not loose or wobbly.</p><h4>Check the Print</h4><p>The print on an authentic Hawaiian shirt should be vibrant and evenly spaced. Look for prints that feature tropical flowers, palm trees, or ocean waves.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><h4>Q: Can I find authentic Hawaiian shirts at department stores?</h4><p>A: While some department stores may carry Hawaiian shirts, they may not be authentic. It's best to visit local shops in Hawaii or online stores that specialize in Hawaiian shirts to ensure you're getting the real deal.</p><h4>Q: How much should I expect to spend on an authentic Hawaiian shirt?</h4><p>A: Authentic Hawaiian shirts can range in price from $50 to $500, depending on the material, print, and brand. Keep in mind that a higher price doesn't always guarantee authenticity.</p><h4>Q: Can I find authentic Hawaiian shirts in other colors besides bright floral prints?</h4><p>A: Yes, you can find authentic Hawaiian shirts in a variety of colors and prints. While bright floral prints are the most popular, you can also find shirts with more subtle prints or solid colors.</p><h4>Q: How do I care for my authentic Hawaiian shirt?</h4><p>A: To care for your authentic Hawaiian shirt, wash it in cold water and hang it to dry. Avoid using a dryer, as it can shrink or damage the fabric. Iron the shirt on low heat if needed.</p><h2>Conclusion of Where to Buy Authentic Hawaiian Shirts</h2><p>When it comes to buying authentic Hawaiian shirts, it's important to know what to look for and where to buy. Visiting local shops in Hawaii, online stores, secondhand stores, and tailors are all great options to consider. Remember to check the label, feel the material, inspect the buttons, and check the print to ensure you're getting an authentic Hawaiian shirt.</p></article>
