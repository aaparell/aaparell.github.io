When it comes to pay per view sales, the most important factor is the number of people willing to pay to watch the fight. This is influenced by the popularity of the fighters, the importance of the event and the overall excitement surrounding the event.</p><p>Personally, I have always been a big fan of boxing and have watched many of the biggest fights in history.

Some of the most notable fights include:</p><p><h3>Mayweather vs Pacquiao</h3></p><p>The Mayweather vs Pacquiao fight in 2015 generated 4.6 million pay per view buys, making it the second highest grossing boxing event of all time. The fight was highly anticipated, as it featured two of the best boxers in the world, and it took years to finally come to fruition.</p><p><h4>How to Watch Boxing Events</h4></p><p>If you are interested in watching a boxing event, there are several ways to do so.
