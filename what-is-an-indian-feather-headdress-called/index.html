They were traditionally worn by Native American chiefs and warriors during ceremonies, battles, and other important events. But what is an Indian feather headdress called, and what is the significance behind it?</p><p>For many Native American tribes, feather headdresses are considered sacred objects and are only worn by those who have earned the right to wear them. They are often made from eagle feathers, which are believed to possess spiritual power and are a symbol of strength and bravery.</p><p>The term for an Indian feather headdress varies depending on the tribe and region. Some tribes refer to them as war bonnets, while others use the term roaches or scalp locks. However, the most commonly recognized term is the war bonnet.</p><p>In essence, war bonnets are a type of headdress that features eagle feathers attached to a headband. The headband is typically adorned with various decorative elements such as beadwork, quills, and horsehair. The number of feathers on a war bonnet can vary depending on the individual wearing it and their rank within the tribe.</p><h2>History and Significance of the War Bonnet</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, feather headdresses are an important symbol of Native American culture. They were traditionally worn by chiefs and warriors to signify their status within the tribe and their bravery in battle.</p><p>Each feather on a war bonnet is earned through acts of courage, such as winning battles or protecting the tribe. The more feathers a person has on their headdress, the more respected they are within the tribe.</p><p>Today, feather headdresses are still worn by some Native American tribes during ceremonies and other cultural events. However, they are not as commonly seen as they were in the past due to the restrictions on the use of eagle feathers and the commercialization of Native American culture.</p><h2>How to Make a War Bonnet</h2><p>Making a war bonnet is a complex process that requires skill and patience. The first step is to create the headband, which can be made from leather, felt, or fabric. The headband is then adorned with decorative elements such as beadwork, quills, and horsehair.</p><p>The feathers are attached to the headband using a series of loops and knots. The number of feathers and their placement on the bonnet can vary depending on the individual's rank within the tribe.</p><h3>Types of Feathers Used in War Bonnets</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, war bonnets are typically made from eagle feathers. However, other types of feathers can also be used, such as turkey, pheasant, and peacock feathers.</p><p>Eagle feathers are preferred because they are believed to possess spiritual power and are a symbol of strength and bravery. However, it is illegal to possess eagle feathers without a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</p><h4>Where to Buy a War Bonnet</h4><p>If you are interested in purchasing a war bonnet, it is important to do your research and make sure you are buying from a reputable source. Many Native American artists and craftspeople sell their work online or at powwows and other cultural events.</p><p>When purchasing a war bonnet, it is important to remember that it is a sacred object and should be treated with respect. It should not be worn as a costume or used for non-ceremonial purposes.</p><h2>Conclusion of What is an Indian Feather Headdress Called</h2><p>In conclusion, an Indian feather headdress is called a war bonnet, and it is a sacred object that holds great significance within Native American culture. It is a symbol of strength, bravery, and status within the tribe. While war bonnets are not as commonly seen today, they continue to be an important part of Native American tradition and should be treated with the utmost respect.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p><b>Q:</b> What is the significance of eagle feathers in war bonnets?</p><p><b>A:</b> Eagle feathers are believed to possess spiritual power and are a symbol of strength and bravery.</p><p><b>Q:</b> Can anyone wear a war bonnet?</p><p><b>A:</b> No, war bonnets are sacred objects that are only worn by those who have earned the right to wear them.</p><p><b>Q:</b> What is the process of making a war bonnet?</p><p><b>A:</b> Making a war bonnet involves creating a headband, attaching decorative elements, and attaching feathers using loops and knots.</p><p><b>Q:</b> Is it legal to possess eagle feathers?</p><p><b>A:</b> It is illegal to possess eagle feathers without a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</p></article>
