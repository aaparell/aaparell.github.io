This match pitted the undefeated heavyweight champion George Foreman against the legendary Muhammad Ali, who was seen as the underdog going into the fight.</p><p>As the fight began, it quickly became clear that Ali had a plan. He employed a tactic known as the "rope-a-dope," which involved him leaning back against the ropes and letting Foreman tire himself out with a flurry of punches. Then, in the eighth round, Ali struck, landing a series of punches that knocked Foreman out and secured him the victory.</p><p><h2>The Thrilla in Manila</h2></p><p>Another iconic fight was the Thrilla in Manila, which took place in the Philippines in 1975. This fight was the third and final match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, and it was one of the most grueling fights in boxing history.</p><p>Ali and Frazier went back and forth for 14 rounds, with both fighters delivering punishing blows and refusing to back down. However, by the 14th round, Frazier was clearly exhausted and unable to continue, leading his trainer to throw in the towel and secure Ali the victory.</p><p><h3>The Fight of the Century</h3></p><p>The Fight of the Century was a highly anticipated match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier that took place in 1971. This fight was the first time that two undefeated heavyweight champions had faced off in the ring, and it was seen as a battle for the ages.</p><p>While Ali was known for his quick footwork and flashy style, Frazier was a more straightforward fighter who relied on his power and stamina. In the end, it was Frazier who secured the victory, landing a series of devastating blows that left Ali bloodied and bruised.</p><p><h4>How to Watch These Fights Today</h4></p><p>If you're interested in watching some of the most exciting boxing fights of all time, there are a few options available to you.
