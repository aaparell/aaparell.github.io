Do you dream of finding a vintage-inspired dress that speaks to your individual style? Look no further. In this guide, we will explore the best places to buy vintage looking dresses, so you can finally find the dress of your dreams.</p><p>It can be frustrating to search for vintage looking dresses, especially if you don't know where to start. You may have tried browsing through thrift stores or online marketplaces, only to find that the selection is limited or the quality is poor. Additionally, you may worry about the authenticity of the vintage pieces, or struggle to find a dress in your size. All of these factors can make the process of finding a vintage inspired dress overwhelming and stressful.</p><p>Fortunately, there are a variety of places where you can find beautiful vintage looking dresses that fit your style, budget, and size. Some of the best options include:</p><p><h2>Online Vintage Clothing Stores</h2></p><p>One of the most convenient ways to find vintage inspired dresses is to shop online. There are a variety of online vintage clothing stores that offer a wide selection of dresses from various eras, including the 1920s, 1950s, and 1970s. These stores often have a range of sizes and styles to choose from, so you can find the perfect dress for any occasion.</p><p>One of my favorite online vintage clothing stores is Unique Vintage. They offer a variety of vintage inspired dresses, ranging from flapper-style dresses to swing dresses to bohemian maxi dresses. I love that they have a size range that includes plus sizes, and they also offer free shipping on orders over $150.</p><p><h2>Local Vintage Shops</h2></p><p>If you prefer to shop in person, you may want to check out local vintage shops in your area. These shops often have a curated selection of vintage inspired dresses, and you can try them on before making a purchase. Additionally, you may be able to find unique pieces that you wouldn't be able to find online.</p><p>One of my favorite local vintage shops is Retro Rejuvenation in downtown Los Angeles.

I love that they have detailed measurements for each dress, so you can ensure a perfect fit.</p><p><h4>Thrift Stores</h4></p><p>While thrift stores may require a bit more effort in terms of searching through racks of clothing, they can be a great place to find vintage inspired dresses at an affordable price. You may need to visit several thrift stores to find the perfect dress, but the thrill of the hunt can be worth it.</p><p>One of my favorite thrift stores for vintage inspired dresses is Crossroads Trading Co. They have a variety of gently used clothing, including vintage inspired dresses from various eras. Additionally, they offer cash or store credit for clothing that you no longer want, so you can declutter your wardrobe while also finding a new dress.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of Where to Buy Vintage Looking Dresses</h2></p><p>Whether you prefer to shop online or in person, there are a variety of options for finding vintage inspired dresses that fit your individual style.
