The fight lived up to its hype, with both boxers delivering punishing blows and refusing to back down. In the end, Frazier emerged victorious in a unanimous decision, but both boxers left everything they had in the ring that night.</p><p><h4>The Legacy of the Greatest Fights in Boxing History</h4></p><p>The greatest fights in boxing history have had a profound impact on the sport, shaping it into what it is today.
