Old, worn-out underwear can cause discomfort, chafing, and even infections. Not to mention, it's not exactly the most attractive look. But even if your underwear is relatively new, it may not be the right fit or style for your body type and lifestyle.</p><p>The target of why men's underwear is important is to provide comfort, support, and protection while also being aesthetically pleasing.
