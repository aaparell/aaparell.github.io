These materials are breathable, comfortable, and durable, making them ideal for everyday wear. </p><p><strong>Q: How do I know if a shirt fits properly?</strong></p><p>A: A shirt should fit snugly around the neck and shoulders without being too tight or too loose. The sleeves should be long enough to cover your wrists and the hem should fall at your hips. </p><p><strong>Q: How do I care for my shirts?</strong></p><p>A: To care for your shirts, always follow the care instructions on the label.
