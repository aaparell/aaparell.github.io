The country's textile industry contributes over 80% of the country's total exports and employs over 4 million people.</p><p>However, the industry faces several challenges, including poor working conditions, low wages, and safety concerns. In recent years, Bangladesh's textile industry has come under scrutiny for its labor practices, prompting calls for better regulations and working conditions.</p><p><h4>Vietnam</h4></p><p>Vietnam is a rising star in the global textile industry, with a rapidly growing export market and a focus on sustainability and innovation.
