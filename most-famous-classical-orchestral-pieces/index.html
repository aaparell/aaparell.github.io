With so many famous pieces and composers to choose from, it can be difficult to know what to listen to first. However, with a little guidance, anyone can start to appreciate and enjoy classical music.</p><h2>What Are Classical Orchestral Pieces?</h2><p>Classical orchestral pieces are large-scale compositions written for a full orchestra, which typically includes strings, woodwinds, brass, and percussion instruments.
