His powerful punches and relentless pursuit of Golovkin helped him to secure the victory.The Importance of Fighting StyleWhen it comes to determining who is the best boxer in the world, fighting style is an essential factor to consider.

It was a highly anticipated rematch between the two boxers, and Alvarez was able to come out on top. His powerful punches and relentless pursuit of Golovkin helped him to secure the victory.</p><p><h3>The Importance of Fighting Style</h3></p><p>When it comes to determining who is the best boxer in the world, fighting style is an essential factor to consider.
