They can be heavily embroidered or embellished with stones or beads.

I wanted to look traditional but also stylish, and the Sherwani allowed me to do that. I chose a cream-colored Sherwani with gold embroidery, and it looked great with a red turban and a pair of Jodhpuri shoes.</p><p><h2>Kurta-Pajama</h2></p><p>Another popular choice for men's wedding dress ideas India is the Kurta-Pajama. It is a simple yet elegant outfit that consists of a long shirt (Kurta) and loose-fitting pants (Pajama). Kurta-Pajamas are available in a variety of fabrics, including cotton, silk, and linen.

The outfit was simple yet elegant, and I received many compliments on it.</p><p><h3>Dhoti-Kurta</h3></p><p>The Dhoti-Kurta is another traditional Indian outfit that is popular for weddings. It consists of a long shirt (Kurta) and a draped cloth (Dhoti) that is wrapped around the legs. Dhoti-Kurtas are available in a variety of fabrics, including cotton, silk, and linen. They can be plain or embroidered, and you can choose from a range of colors to suit your preference.</p><p>The Dhoti-Kurta is a comfortable outfit that allows for easy movement. However, it can be challenging to wear for those who are not accustomed to it. I have not personally worn a Dhoti-Kurta, but I have seen many men look great in this outfit.</p><p><h4>Bandhgala</h4></p><p>The Bandhgala is a modern take on traditional Indian attire.

They can be plain or embroidered, and you can choose from a range of colors to suit your preference.</p><p>I have not personally worn a Bandhgala, but I have seen many men look great in this outfit.
