It's not just about the size, but it's about the fit as well. I've had to purchase a men's shirt on several occasions, and each time I've had to consider the fit carefully. </p><p>One thing to keep in mind is that men's shirts are typically designed to be roomier and have a more relaxed fit than women's shirts.

You can use a measuring tape to take the following measurements:</p><p><h3>Chest</h3></p><p>Measure around the fullest part of the chest, ensuring that the tape is parallel to the ground.</p><p><h3>Waist</h3></p><p>Measure around the natural waistline, which is the narrowest part of the waist. Ensure that the tape is snug but not too tight.</p><p><h3>Shoulder</h3></p><p>Measure from the end of one shoulder to the end of the other shoulder, across the back.</p><p><h3>Sleeve</h3></p><p>Measure from the shoulder seam to the end of the cuff.</p><p><h2>Can a Man Wear a Ladies Size 18 Shirt?</h2></p><p>Yes, a man can wear a ladies size 18 shirt, but it may not fit correctly. A ladies size 18 shirt is designed to fit a female body, so it may be tighter around the chest and waist for a man. Additionally, the sleeves may be shorter, and the shoulders may not fit correctly. </p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><strong>Q: Can a size 18 women's shirt fit a man who wears a size medium?</strong></p><p>A: No, a size 18 women's shirt is equivalent to an XL or extra-large size in men's clothing.</p><p><strong>Q: What is the difference between men's and women's shirt sizes?</strong></p><p>A: Men's shirts are designed to be roomier and have more space in the chest and shoulders, while women's shirts are tailored to fit around the bust and waist.</p><p><strong>Q: Can a man wear a ladies size 18 shirt?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, a man can wear a ladies size 18 shirt, but it may not fit correctly. </p><p><strong>Q: How can I measure for a men's shirt for a woman?</strong></p><p>A: You can measure the chest, waist, shoulder, and sleeve for a men's shirt for a woman.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of What is a Ladies Size 18 Shirt in Men's</h2></p><p>In conclusion, a ladies size 18 shirt in men's is equivalent to an XL or extra-large size in men's clothing.
