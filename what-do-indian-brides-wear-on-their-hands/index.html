A Guide to Bridal Accessories</strong></p><p>If you're attending an Indian wedding, one of the most striking things you'll notice about the bride's outfit is the intricate and ornate accessories she's wearing on her hands. These accessories are an important part of the bridal ensemble, and they hold deep cultural significance. However, for those who are not familiar with Indian weddings, these accessories can be confusing and overwhelming.</p><p>For those wondering what do Indian brides wear on their hands, the answer is a collection of accessories known as "haath phools," "bajubands," "kadas," and "chudas." These accessories are worn on different parts of the hand, from the wrist to the upper arm, and each has its own unique design and meaning.</p><p>In this guide, we'll take a closer look at each of these accessories and what they represent. We'll also explore the materials and styles used to create these accessories, as well as some tips on how to choose the right ones for your bridal ensemble.</p><h2>Haath Phools</h2><p>Haath phools are hand ornaments that consist of a bracelet attached to a ring. The bracelet is worn around the wrist, while the ring is worn on the middle finger. Haath phools are typically made of gold, silver, or meenakari (enamel work), and are adorned with precious stones and pearls.</p><p>Personally, I wore a haath phool on my wedding day, and it was one of my favorite accessories. The haath phool I chose had intricate meenakari work and was studded with emeralds and pearls. It added a touch of elegance to my bridal ensemble and made my hands look even more beautiful.</p><h2>Bajubands</h2><p>Bajubands are armlets that are worn on the upper arm. They are typically made of gold or silver and are adorned with precious stones and pearls. Bajubands are a symbol of strength and power, and they are often worn by brides as a way to show their confidence and courage.</p><p>When I got married, I wore a gold bajuband that had intricate filigree work and was studded with diamonds. It was the perfect accessory to complement my bridal attire, and it made me feel like a queen.</p><h3>Kadas</h3><p>Kadas are thick bangles that are worn on the wrist. They are typically made of gold or silver and are adorned with intricate designs and precious stones. Kadas are a symbol of good fortune and prosperity, and they are often given as gifts to brides to bring them luck and success in their new life.</p><p>On my wedding day, I wore a set of kadas that had intricate floral designs and were studded with rubies and emeralds. They were a beautiful addition to my bridal ensemble and made my hands look even more elegant.</p><h4>Chudas</h4><p>Chudas are a set of red and ivory bangles that are worn by Punjabi brides. They are typically made of ivory and lac and are adorned with intricate designs and embellishments. Chudas are a symbol of fertility and prosperity, and they are worn by brides for several weeks after the wedding ceremony.</p><p>Although I did not wear chudas on my wedding day, I have seen many brides who have. The chudas add a traditional touch to the bridal ensemble and look stunning when paired with the right outfit.</p><h2>Conclusion of What Do Indian Brides Wear on Their Hands</h2><p>Indian bridal accessories are an important part of the bridal ensemble, and they hold deep cultural significance. From haath phools to bajubands, kadas, and chudas, each accessory has its own unique design and meaning. When choosing your bridal accessories, it's important to consider the style of your outfit and the overall look you want to achieve. With the right accessories, you can elevate your bridal ensemble and make your hands look even more beautiful.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p><strong>Q: Can I wear haath phools without a ring?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, haath phools can be worn without a ring.</p><p><strong>Q: Do all Indian brides wear chudas?</strong></p><p>A: No, chudas are traditionally worn by Punjabi brides.</p><p><strong>Q: Are bridal accessories expensive?</strong></p><p>A: Bridal accessories can range in price depending on the materials used and the design of the accessory.
