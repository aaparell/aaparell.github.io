As societies became more complex, clothing began to have social and cultural significance, indicating a person's status, gender, and occupation. </p><p>During the Middle Ages, clothing became more elaborate and ornate, reflecting the rise of the fashion industry and the emergence of different social classes. The Renaissance period saw a return to classical styles, with clothing becoming more tailored and fitted. </p><p>In the 20th century, clothing became more accessible and affordable, with mass production and globalization leading to a proliferation of fashion trends and styles.
