Some of the most popular styles include the spread collar, the point collar, and the button-down collar. But where did these styles come from? </p><p>Personally, I have always been fascinated by the history of men's shirt collars. My grandfather used to tell me stories about the different collars he wore during his lifetime. He had a particular fondness for the wing collar, which he wore to many formal events. </p><p>Men's shirt collars have been around for centuries.
